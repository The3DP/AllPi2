# About "Pi-2.py"
The file, "Pi2.py" burns all cores in the Raspberry Pi CPU.
ONLY RUN THIS TEST IF YOUR RASBERRY PI IS EQUIPPED WITH STRONG COOLING GEAR.
YOU ARE RUNNING THIS TEST AT YOUR OWN RISK, AND I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY
DAMAGE DONE TO YOUR DEVICE.

If you would like to run a not so extreme Raspberry Pi CPU test, than check out this repository:
